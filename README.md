# Butterfly Emulator - ZapHotel.net Pack (R63A)

![Butterfly Emulator Logo](bin/SIwL22j.png)

A classic **Butterfly Emulator** release from early 2013, originally used by **Zap Hotel** before moving on to an R63B build. This pack gives you everything needed for a fully working retro experience, showcasing what Habbo Hotel was like around 2012/2013.

I’m posting this out of my passion for retro Habbo, and I’m using this opportunity to store and archive it for future generations.
