# Butterfly Emulator - ZapHotel.net Pack (R63A)

![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nokrato/Zap-Hotel/refs/heads/main/assets/logo.png)

A classic **Butterfly Emulator** release from early 2013, originally used by **Zap Hotel** before moving on to an R63B build. This pack gives you everything you need for a fully working retro experience—capturing what Habbo Hotel was like around 2012/2013.

I’m posting this out of my passion for retro Habbo and using this opportunity to store and archive it for future generations.
